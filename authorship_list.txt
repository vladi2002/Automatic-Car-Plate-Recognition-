Work division:

Both authors have split their work equally and all elements were developped together in each others' physical presence. 
This makes the split of work by the two authors in features impossible as all elements had 50%-50% contribution.
Hence, we would like to declare that we had a 50% to 50% split on all system features.
Therefore, this declaration may serve as proof that both authors are equally responsible for all features of the system
and may therefore be evaluated in the same way. 
This document shall serve as equivalent to the authorship list described in the assignment description.
